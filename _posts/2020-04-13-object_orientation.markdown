I felt that object orientation was a very interesting topic. The different ways we could store objects and the different ways we could scrape different type of data and turn them into objects for us to use later was very neat. I like how we could have one file that creates all the objects for us and then use it in another file which is used in an application. For example getting character names from Movies and the years they were released. Use that to portray information out to the user asking for that information. It seemed really simple when I was a user to get the information I wanted but in the background, object orienting and understanding what goes where was very interesting and it was some hard work for sure. All in all I think I have a pretty good idea of Object Orientation and how to use it and I feel like that was a huge accomplishment throughout this course.
