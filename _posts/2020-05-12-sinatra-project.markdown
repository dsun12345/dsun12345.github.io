Throughout this project, there were many challenges that had to be overcome, but I think it was a really good project in a sense that it brought everything together. It brought how we do CRUD and actually see it on a live webpage. We were able ot create our own websites and make the changes we want to it and portray what we want to show. This was really cool seeings how we can interact with the user interface with what we were doing to our code and how the idea of object orientation is very important. You have to know what object you are calling and how they interact with each other for the website to not run into errors. It was also really cool learning about password digest and how they take a simple password and transform it into a complex string so hackers can't hack it. How we use SQL code to create tables and classes can belong to another class or a class has many classes under it. This was kind of a whole thing that we've learned combined into one project and it sure helped me excel at my coding skills!
