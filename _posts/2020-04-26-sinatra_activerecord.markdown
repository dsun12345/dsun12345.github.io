Starting to learn about Sinatra and Activerecord and how all these methods are actually already implemented in some of the gems that we use makes it a lot simpler for us to use. It was really cool to see all the gems that took up the normal methods that we would be writing. It was also really cool to see how Sinatra makes it easier for the user to use and when writing out the forms it was really cool to see how it gets translated into real web application. I really loved watching my work turn into a live website and something i could click on that would direct me to different webpages and different routes. It was really neat to see how everything came together and that I am ready for my project to begin and start building my own version of a webpage. This course has definitely taught me lots of skills that I did not have.
