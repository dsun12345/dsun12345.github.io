Hashes and Arrays were something special. I learned that you could store the information you wanted in arrays and it was really neat that in hashes you could point to it with a key. It was really cool to see all the different enumerators you could use on an array/hash to obtain the result one wanted. For example if we just want the first element of the array to use the .first enumerator. Also the each_with_index method to create a list. For example if we want a list of grocery store items to have each item be represented and have an index number to it was very neat. It's going to be more and more arrays and hashes in the future and getting fluent with it is going to help in the future.
