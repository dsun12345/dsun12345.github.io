Since college days I have enjoyed coding because I thought it brought of challenging thoughts and ideas to my mind. I did not get a chance to code fresh out of college instead went out to the hardware field and learned reliability engineering which was interesting. After 4 years in hardware field, I feel that some of the technology that I have been dealing with are very old and I would like to be ahead on the technology field and I feel like software engineering provides the opportunity to do so. Also I feel like software engineering provides opportunities to solve very complex problems. I really like challenges and I think software engineering will provide the opportunity to solve complex problems and lead me to a better life.
