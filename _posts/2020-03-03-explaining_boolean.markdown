The CLI Project further enhanced my understanding of how to create an app and how things come together for users to use. It might be perfect yet was a good way to get started to learn how we would grab information from different websites and use that to create our own app. It was also very neat that I could add things in, for example adding comments of the user who is using the app and adding it into the existing database and present it the next time the selection pops up again. It was very interesting to see how everything that I've learned to this point worked together and how it helped create a mini project app that people could actually use if they wanted to. All in all this was a great chance to apply the knowledge that we have learned and demonstrate our abilities.
