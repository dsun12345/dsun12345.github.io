Boolean in coding normally gives us either a true value or a false value and we can use this to our advantage in various different ways. We could set various conditions within a if statement using an "or", or "and" operator to link various conditions together. We could program it in such a way that if the condition is not met, which will be returned as a false in coding, we could then say to do a certain action, for example quit the program or keep asking the user for a proper input. Boolean helps it make it simple because it's true or false, and we could use that to our advantage when we are programming to set up if statements and or see what our code is returning value is. It really helps out in the sense that you will either get a true or false as a return value and you have to figure out whether you want your program to move on when it's true or false. It is a really neat design to help programmers.
